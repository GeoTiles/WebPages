Overview & Scope

Automated Deduction in Geometry (ADG) is a forum to exchange ideas and views, to present research results and progress, and to demonstrate software tools at the intersection between geometry and automated deduction.
Scope

Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):

    polynomial algebra, invariant and coordinate-free methods;
    probabilistic, synthetic, and logic approaches, techniques for automated geometric reasoning from discrete mathematics, combinatorics, and numeric;
    interactive theorem proving in geometry;
    symbolic and numeric methods for geometric computation, geometric constraint solving, automated generation/reasoning and manipulation with diagrams;
    design and implementation of geometry software, automated theorem provers, special-purpose tools, experimental studies;
    applications of ADG in mechanics, geometric modeling, CAGD/CAD, computer vision, robotics and education;
    automated deduction in non-euclidean geometries;
    artificial intelligence methods in automated reasoning in geometry;
    applications in education of automated deduction in geometry.

CADE 30

ADG2025 will be a satellite event of CADE30 and it will take place from 1-2 August, in Stuttgart, Germany.
