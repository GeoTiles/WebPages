ADG 202

Fifteenth International Conference on Automated Deduction in Geometry

1, 2 of August 2025,  Stuttgart, Germany (satellite event of CADE30)

https://www.uc.pt/events/adg/2025/

Overview

ADG is a forum to exchange ideas and views, to present research
results and progress, and to demonstrate software tools at the
intersection between geometry and automated deduction. 

The conference is held every two years. The previous editions of ADG
were held in Belgrade, in 2023, Hagenberg in 2021 (online, postponed
from 2020 due to COVID-19), Nanning in 2018, Strasbourg in 2016,
Coimbra in 2014, Edinburgh in 2012, Munich in 2010, Shanghai in 2008,
Pontevedra in 2006, Gainesville in 2004, Hagenberg in 2002, ZÃ¼rich in
2000, Beijing in 1998, and Toulouse in 1996.

The 15th edition, ADG 2025, will be held, 1, 2 of August 2025,
Stuttgart, Germany

Scope
Relevant topics include (but are not limited to):

    polynomial algebra, invariant and coordinate-free methods;
    probabilistic, synthetic, and logic approaches, techniques for automated geometric reasoning from discrete mathematics, combinatorics, and numeric;
    interactive theorem proving in geometry;
    symbolic and numeric methods for geometric computation, geometric constraint solving, automated generation/reasoning and manipulation with diagrams;
    design and implementation of geometry software, automated theorem provers, special-purpose tools, experimental studies;
    applications of ADG in mechanics, geometric modeling, CAGD/CAD, computer vision, robotics and education;
    automated deduction in non-euclidean geometries;
    artificial intelligence methods in automated reasoning in geometry;
    applications in education of automated deduction in geometry.

Submission Guidelines

We invite submission of extended abstracts (3 to 12 pages excluding bibliography).

The submissions abstracts must address the following aspects explicitly.

    Problem: What is the problem/question/objective?
    Motivation: Why do we work on the problem? What is the importance?
    State of the Art: What has been done already on the problem?
    Contribution: What is the main original contribution?
    Main Idea: What is the main idea underlying the contribution?

The submissions should follow the standard Springer LNCS Proceedings format.

Submission for ADG is via the host conference (CADE30)
 EasyChair, https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cade30, which will
 ask the submitter to select the proper track.  


Refereeing and Publication:

The submitted extended abstracts will be reviewed by the Program
Committee.

Informal proceedings (of abstracts accepted for presentation) will be
available from the conference web page. The authors are free to submit
their abstracts for publication in other forums.

The authors of extended abstracts accepted for presentation at the
conference will be invited to submit their full papers for publication
in formal post proceedings of ADG 2025 after the conference. A special
issue in Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence (AMAI) was
organized for ADG 2021 and 2023, former post-proceedings for ADG
appeared as special issues of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence
(LNAI).
