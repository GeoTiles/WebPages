Call for Extended Abstracts & Demonstrations

14th International Workshop on Theorem proving components for Educational software

1, 2 of August 2025,  Stuttgart, Germany (satellite event of CADE30)

https://www.uc.pt/events/thedu/thedu25

Overview

Topics of interest include:
  * interactive and automated theorem provers designed or adapted
    for education;
  * methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input;
  * combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems to
    propose next step guidance;
  * combination of symbolic artificial intelligence and machine
    learning for the teaching of proof and proving;
  * design of libraries of statements and/or formal proofs for use
    in educational systems;
  * graphical user interfaces for theorem proving in the classroom;
  * specific systems integrated in educational components such as
    dynamic geometry software, automatic provers providing readable
    output or explicit counter examples, etc.;
  * the role of logic and formal systems in the didactic of proof
    and proving in mathematics education;
  * experience reports about the use of automatic or interactive
    theorem provers for teaching.
  * evaluation of the impact of intelligent tutoring systems 
    for proof and proving

Submissions:

   We welcome submissions of extended abstracts and demonstration
   proposals presenting original unpublished work which is not been
   submitted for publication elsewhere.

   All accepted extended abstracts and demonstrations will be presented
   at the workshop. Abstracts will be made available online.

   Extended abstracts and demonstration proposals should be submitted
   via easychair in the dedicated track of CADE-30 https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cade30,    formatted according to http://www.easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip
   Extended abstracts and demonstration proposals should be 5-10 pages (excluding bibliography and potential appendix)   in length and are to be submitted in PDF format.

   At least one of the authors of each accepted extended
   abstract/demonstration proposal is expected to attend THedu'25 and 
   presents their extended abstract/demonstration.
