 
ThEdu'25

14th International Workshop on Theorem proving components for Educational software

Topics of interest include:
* interactive and automated theorem provers designed or adapted for education;
* methods of automated deduction applied to checking students' input;
* combinations of deduction and computation enabling systems to propose next step guidance;
* combination of symbolic artificial intelligence and machine learning for the teaching of proof and proving;
* design of libraries of statements and/or formal proofs for use in educational systems;
* graphical user interfaces for theorem proving in the classroom;
* specific systems integrated in educational components such as dynamic geometry software, automatic provers providing readable output or explicit counter examples, etc.;
* the role of logic and formal systems in the didactic of proof and proving in mathematics education;
* experience reports about the use of automatic or interactive theorem provers for teaching.
* evaluation of the impact of intelligent tutoring systems for proof and proving

ThEdu'25, will be a satellite event of the 30th International Conference on Automated Deduction (CADE-30) that will take place from July 28th to July 31st, 2025 in Stuttgart, Germany, with workshops and satellite events on August 1st and 2nd.
